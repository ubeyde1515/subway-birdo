about developer: My name is ubeyde, I was born in 2006 and I'm working on game developing since 2023..

about game: It's one of my first project. so It's very simple you just have to "dont touch" to anything but coin and superpowers. you need to be sure that you didn't fall while dodging the pipes

controls: use arrow keys to change the line you moving. (character moves forvard himself) and use spacebar for a wingbeat.
